Step 1: Setup everything
Add the generated root CA certificate to trusted root certificates

Double-click on rootCA.crt
Click "Install certificate"
Select "Local Machine," then click "Next"
Select "Place all certificates in the following store," click "Browse" and select "Trusted Root Certification"
Click "Finish" ( only needed to do 1 time )
Same thing for keyauth.win.crt Certificate but Just pressing next works fine ( also 1 time also )
